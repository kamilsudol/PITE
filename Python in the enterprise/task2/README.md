Report form classes no 2.


What have I learned during last PITE labs?
I have learned many new things such like:

- how to work with big dictionaries in Python,
- how to use and store data with Json, which can be reusable,
- how to use filters in Python,
- how to use lambda's in Python,
- how to use "try" and "exception",
- functions with more than 3 indentation are called big functions,
- Python has build-n functions for example to make sum of whole list,
